# value-control-with-hand-gesture
This system lets you control your PC’s volume using simple hand gestures. By using a webcam and hand tracking technology, it detects the distance between your thumb and index finger. Bringing the fingers closer lowers the volume, while spreading them apart increases it—no need for a mouse or keyboard.
